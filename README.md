# Repository for ETL Mini-Project

## Background
  *  Practice building an ETL pipline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods.
  *  A successful project will do the following:
    * Extract data from large excel file into smaller, seperate csv files:
      * Create Category and Subcategory DataFrame
      * Create Campaign DataFrame
      * Create Contacts DataFrame
      * Use cleaned data to create Crowdfunding Database in PostgreSQL

## Housekeeping
  * Cleaned data can be found in the [Resources](https://github.com/StanJohn04/crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Resources) folder
  * All SQL statements for creating the DataBase, select statements to verify data, and the jupyter notebook used to clean the data can be found in the [Crowdfunding folder](https://github.com/StanJohn04/crowdfunding_ETL/tree/main/Crowdfunding)
